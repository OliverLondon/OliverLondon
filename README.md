Hi, I’m @OliverLondon and I'm a graduate from Univeristy of Oregon with a passion in Computer Science and Data Managent. 

I have a Bachelors in Computer Information Science with a minor in Planning, Public Policy and Management which deals with Charities and their function, City planning and the difficulties that come with designing infrastructure that functions efficiently for vehicles as well as remaining useful public spaces that incorporate nature and relaxation areas.

I'm interested in Working in fields with large sets of data to hone my skills in aggregating, organizing, and simplifying the data into concise and clear images or data points and trends. I believe that working with Big Data would be a fun experience, but I also believe that I need to start a bit smaller and gain experience first.

I have spent the most time working with Python and C/C++, with strong knowledge of Google App Scripts when it comes to its applications in Google Sheets and augments the sheet with more advanced functionality than is offered in the base widgets.

I can be contacted best through my main email: olivertwister24680@gmail.com
